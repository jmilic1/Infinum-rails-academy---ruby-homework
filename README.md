# Infinum Backend Academy: Homework Ruby

## Setup

Before starting to work on your homework assignments, setup development environment by running
`bin/setup` script which installs all necessary dependencies.

## Playing with solutions

Starting a console, `bin/console`, will import all your code into interactive ruby session, where you can
experiment with your solutions.

## Runing specs

Specs verify that your solution satisfies all expectations. You can run different scope of specs,
two most common are:
  * whole suite                                 (`rspec`)
  * only specs regarding particular assignment  (`rspec -t [compress|election_winner|gift_shop|holes|oib|open_class|phonetic_alphabet|shatro|tic_tac_toe]`)
