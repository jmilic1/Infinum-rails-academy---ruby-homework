# Implement a function that counts the number of holes(enclosed spaces) in a number. Use the
# following table as a reference for the number of holes of a specific digit. For example the input
# number 100 should return a result of 2
#
# Digit | Holes
# ------+------
#   0   |   1
#   1   |   0
#   2   |   0
#   3   |   0
#   4   |   1
#   5   |   0
#   6   |   1
#   7   |   0
#   8   |   2
#   9   |   1
