# Implement a class, `Oib`, that represents one OIB number.
#
# On instantiation `Oib` constructor will be called with an oib number(a string). Constructor should
# store the code and perform initial validation of code length and code format(all characters should
# be digits). If any of the preceding constraints are not met, the constructor should raise an
# `ArgumentError` exception with appropriate message:
#   - when the code is shorter than 11 characters, `Code is too short`
#   - when the code is longer than 11 characters, `Code is too long`
#   - when the code contains characters besides digits, `Code should contain only digits`
#
# Oib class should also expose one public method, `Oib#valid?`, which checks whether code satisfies
# mathematical properties for valid OIB number(is control digit correct or not).
#
# Procedure for calculating control code is described in
#   https://regos.hr/app/uploads/2018/07/KONTROLA-OIB-a.pdf
