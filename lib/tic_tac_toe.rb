# Implement a function which detects the winner of a tic-tac-toe game. The function accepts a single
# argument, a board(represented as an array), with position markers for both players. There are
# three possible values for a marker on board, 'X', 'O' or nil(nobody marked that field). The board
# is encoded as an array of three elements. Each element in the board array represents one row and
# each row contains three elements which represent the columns. The function should return a winner
# marker 'X', 'O', or 'D' in case of a draw (nobody won).
#
# Eg:
#  X | O | X    [ ['X', 'O', 'X'],
# ---+---+---
#    | X | O      [nil, 'X', 'O'],
# ---+---+---
#  X | O |        ['X', 'O', nil] ]
#
#  winner is 'X'
